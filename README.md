# ERC-20 Token Swap Contract

# Description

This project implements an order-based ERC-20 token swap contract, allowing users to deposit various ERC-20 tokens and specify the token they want in return at a specific exchange rate. Users can create swap orders, and others can purchase the deposited tokens by fulfilling the order using the token requested by the depositor.

# Features

Token Deposits: Users can deposit one type of ERC-20 token in exchange for another.

Order-Based Swaps: Depositors specify the token they are depositing, the amount, and the token they want in return, creating a swap order.

Token Purchases: Other users can fulfill a swap order by providing the requested tokens.
